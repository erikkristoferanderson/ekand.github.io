title: Show Your Work
---

I've developed a habit for making YouTube videos, a yearning for online fame and fortune, and an interest in the videos of Ali Abdaal. In one of his videos, he plugs the book "Show Your Work!" by Austin Kleon. I haven't read the book, but the main idea seems to be tha you should share your process as you work through things.

In that spirit, here's something I worked on today: a python implementation of Conway's Game of Life. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life 

In the process of making that implementation, I gained a few skills and recognized the value of some skills I already had. The new skills include

- pygame
- pytest

The existing skills include

- Python programming
- Test driven development

And that's where I'll stop for today, since tiredness and shyness is making me think that now is the time to close my computer.
