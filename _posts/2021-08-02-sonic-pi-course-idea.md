title: Compose Atmospheric Music Using Sonic Pi
---

I have this idea for a Skillshare course. Skillshare courses center around a project. For this course, the project would be compsing atmospheric music using the program Sonic Pi.

To keep things simple, I'll have prescriptive rules for what programming structures to use and what notes to use. But I'll leave room for creativity in the ordering of the notes, and the octaves of the notes.
