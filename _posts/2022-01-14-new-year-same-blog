title: New Year, Same Blog

Apparently this blog still exists. Neat! (?)

I'll say a few things about what I've been doing.

I've been working as support engineer in the analytics arm of a small ad agency. A new job often means learning new technologies. Here are some of those:

- Terraform
- AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM)
- Kubernetes

It also means deepening your acquaintance with familiar tools. Some of those are here:

- git
- GitHub
- Airflow
- AWS, in all its sprawling glory
- CloudFormation
- S3
- EC2

I've also recently been bitten by the freelance bug, and am looking at Freemote, UpWork, and BrainTrust.

That's it for now.
