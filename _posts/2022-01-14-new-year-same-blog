title: New Year, Same Blog

Apparently this blog still exists. Neat! (?)

I'll say a few things about what I've been doing.

I've been working as support engineer in the analytics arm of a small ad agency. A new job often means learning new technologies. Here are some of those:

- Terraform
- AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM)
- Kubernetes

It also means deepening your acquaintance with familiar tools. Some of those are here:

- git
- GitHub
- Airflow
- AWS, in all its sprawling glory
- CloudFormation
- S3
- EC2

I've also recently been bitten by the freelance bug, and am looking at Freemote, UpWork, and BrainTrust.

I also have a startup idea. And if I want to keep it secret, right here is a pretty good place to put it, don't you think? But seriously. The idea involves sending customized email notifications about reddit posts. It would be a paid subscription. I call it Syfty. And with that, it's out in the world. No more stealth mode. Not that it was every really in stealth mode. But it is kinda fun to say stealth mode.
